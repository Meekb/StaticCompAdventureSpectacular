## Turing Trading Cards

### A Static Comp Challenge


Front-End Project by: [Beth Meeker](https://github.com/Meekb)

## Overview
  Turing Trading Cards is a comp challenge designed to flex some muscle in HTML and CSS while utilizing breakpoints for repsonsive design.
  Using a bit of creative license, the deployed page was re-created based off of a provided static comp. Trading Trading Cards feature current 
  students in Modules 2 and 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. Each Turing Trading Card links to the student's GitHub profile.

## Construction
  
  * Two main files: index.html and styles.css
  * Assets were compiled from Slack's Turing channel with the permission of each student
  * Employed breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480 px for responsive design enjoyable on desktop, tablet, or mobile
  * Image overlay to 'View Full Profile' which currently links to the student's GitHub profile
  * Turing link goes to Turing.edu
  * Code Wars button takes the user to the Code Wars website

## Technologies
  1. HTML, CSS
  2. CSS Normalize (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
