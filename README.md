## Turing Trading Cards: A Static Comp Challenge

A Front-End Project by: [Beth Meeker](https://github.com/Meekb)

## Overview
  Turing Trading Cards is a comp challenge designed to exercise skills in HTML and CSS while utilizing breakpoints for repsonsive design.
  Using a bit of creative license, the deployed page was re-created based off of a provided static comp. Trading Trading Cards feature current 
  students in Modules 2 and 3.

## Construction
  
  * Two main files: index.html and styles.css
  * Assets were compiled from Slack's Turing channel with the permission of each student
  * Employed breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480 px for responsive design enjoyable on desktop, tablet, or mobile
